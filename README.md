# Project Task: Frontend Application with State Management

## Overview
Create a frontend application using a state management tool (e.g., Context API or Redux) to manage global data across the application. Connect this frontend to a backend application built previously.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - Redux (or Context API)
  - Axios (for API calls)
  - React Router (for navigation)
  - Notistack (for notifications)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB (or your preferred database)
  - Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)

## Task Details

### Frontend Development
1. **Setup and Dependencies:**
   - Created a React frontend application.
   - Installed necessary dependencies: React, Redux (or Context API), Axios, React Router, Notistack.

2. **Integration with State Management:**
   - Implemented Redux (or Context API) for managing global state.
   - Used actions and reducers to manage state related to user authentication, API responses, etc.

3. **Connection to Backend:**
   - Configured Axios to make HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints.
   - Integrated frontend components with backend routes for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

4. **Component Development:**
   - Developed UI components such as forms for creating and editing data (e.g., books).
   - Implemented reusable components for UI consistency.

5. **Functionality:**
   - Implemented login functionality using API responses managed by Redux (or Context API).
   - Managed session state and user authentication tokens.

6. **Error Handling and Notifications:**
   - Implemented error handling for API requests.
   - Integrated Notistack for displaying user-friendly notifications (success, error messages).

### Issues Faced
- **State Management Challenges:**
  - Understanding and implementing Redux (or Context API) for global state management.
  - Debugging state inconsistencies and ensuring proper data flow.

- **Integration with Backend:**
  - Handling CORS issues during frontend-backend integration.
  - Troubleshooting API request/response mismatches.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Optimizing API requests to minimize latency and improve user experience.

## Conclusion
This project aimed to demonstrate proficiency in frontend development with state management using Redux (or Context API) and integrating it with a backend application. Challenges such as state management complexities and backend integration issues were successfully addressed, resulting in a functional application with robust user authentication and data management capabilities.
